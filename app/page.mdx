Hey there, I'm an software engineer from Belgium working at [DPG Media](https://www.dpgmediagroup.com/). I'm particularly interrested in building tools for thoughts and better UX for agents.

I'm currently building [Reader](https://github.com/rurangiza/reader), a web app to help annotate your books.
